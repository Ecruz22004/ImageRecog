Articial Intelligence Image Reconition System:

Our goal in creating this system is creating a system that can
take an input of a photograph that contains items (ex bike, bowling ball etc)
then assign names and values to these items and output a catagorized list that can state 
missing items and estimated value according to certain bench marks
